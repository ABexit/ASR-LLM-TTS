This is a speech interaction system built on an open-source model, integrating ASR, LLM, and TTS in sequence. 
The ASR model is SenceVoice, 
the LLM models are QWen2.5-0.5B/1.5B, 
there are three TTS models: CosyVoice, Edge-TTS, and pyttsx3. 
CosyVoice has a slower synthesis speed, pyttsx3 sounds overly mechanical, while Edge-TTS offers superior efficiency and quality.
